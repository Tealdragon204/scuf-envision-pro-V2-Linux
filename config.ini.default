# Set to true to completely disable USB audio (headphone jack) on the
# SCUF controller. The audio device is unbound from the kernel driver
# so applications (PipeWire, PulseAudio, etc.) will not see it at all.
#
# To toggle at runtime:  sudo scuf-audio-toggle disable|enable
# To apply after editing: sudo systemctl restart scuf-envision
